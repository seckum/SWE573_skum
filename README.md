GIT is basically a version control system, it is very useful with team work. Every team member can see their tasks and update their works to the GIT-Hub and every team member can follow the latest code. Changed section can be traced very easily. 
According to my research many users were adviced to use GIT terminal. In this terminal you can send your work to GIT-Hub with the codes. Also you can upload from the GIT-Hub desktop application which has very user friendly screens. I tried to use both of them.
Some git terminal notes as below;
-git init *initiliaze local git repository*
-git add  *add files to index
-git status *checks the status of working space*
-git commit *commit changes*
-git push *push to remote repository.*
-git pull *pull latest form of your remote repository.*

When you open the git hub you should create repository, which is your working space. You will put your work here in an order. Also you should also create your local working space in your computer so you arre cloning the repository at git hub. Clonning means this.
--You worked on your computer and changed some of the documents. Before sending to remote repository you have to follow belowed sequences.
--- git status (You will see the changed documents)
--- git add . ( You are saying I want to upload these files to remote repo)
--- git commit -m" I changed this files for that reason etc..." (You  have to explain what changed before the send process)
--- git push (Now you are uploading the files)
--- git status (You should see as green color at changed file names)

If you want to download latest works from the git.You should follow belowed sequences.
- cd/desktop
-ls
    - working file(master)
-cd/working file
-git status
-git pull 

At git envoirenment you can select your friends as contributor so they could follow your work or they could review or update your codes.
You can create project section where you can follow the open issues and timelines.
You can customise your labels with different colors, this defines the work you are doing.(Exp. Urgent)
