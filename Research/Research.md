# SWE573 HW-1 Wikidata Research

Wikidata is created by the volunteers. People around the world make contribution to system.

Simply we can say data version of wikipedia. You can also make the contribution by adding new information to the system. Wikidata is focusing on data structuring. *There was quick tutorial in the page  I also looked on it, it was mentioned about how editing the or how we can adding the ddata to the system.* 

When we are adding new information we should be careful about belowed terms.
- **Labels** : They should be short as possible and except from some special cases it shouldn't start with capital letter. By the way it doesn't need to be unique. For example when we enter the data bout the Earth, we should labe it Earth not The planet Earth or The Earth. It should be exact and shortest as possible.
- **Description**: Differantiate labels with adding on new details. It shouldn't be more than two-three words.
- **Aliases** : Similar meanings of label, for example if the label is Earth this could be world.

I controlled a few API's and how they are worked, there was a library which includes the basic web applications which using Wikidata APIs.
I didn't worked with APIs before so I just watch some videos who used the APIs. 
Also I just make some trials on Postamn sending and recieving but I need more time to understand it.
